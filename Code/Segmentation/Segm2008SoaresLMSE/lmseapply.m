% Applies the linear classifier in "linearfilename" created using
% "lmsecreatelinear". Returns the classification result in "class" and
% the result of the linear function in "classgray". "featurefilename"
% is the name of the file with the image features. 
%
% The threshold is subtracted from "classgray", so that classgray > 0
% produces "class"."normalizeflag" is optional and is 0 if the same
% normalization is to be used for the training samples and the ones
% being classified (default is different normalization).
