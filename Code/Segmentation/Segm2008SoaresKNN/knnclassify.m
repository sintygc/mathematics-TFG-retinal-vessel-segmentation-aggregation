%
% Classifies image pixels using k-nearest neighbors.
%
% Receives:
%
% "featurefilename": name of file with pixel image features to be
% classified.
%
% "processedfilename": normalized labeled processed training
% samples file.
%
% "k": Number of neighbors used for classification.
%
% "normalizeflag": optional parameter. Is 0 if the same normalization
% is to be used for the training samples and the ones being
% classified.
%
% Returns:
%
% "class": The final classification.
%
% "classgray": grayscale representation of votes for vessel.
