function lmsecreatelinear(processedfilename, linearfilename)
% function lmsecreatelinear(processedfilename, linearfilename)
%
% Creates linear classifier.
%
% Creates the linear classifier function based on samples from
% "processedfilename". Saves the classifier in "linearfilename". The
% file "processedfilename" should have been created using
% "createprocessed" and contains normalized labeled training samples.
%
% The function minimizes the sum of squared errors from the desired
% output and real output on the training set. The training is the
% using the pseudo-inverse method and assigning labels 1 and -1 for
% desired output of classes 0 and 1.
%
% See also: testmixed, lmseapply, createprocessed.
