function createfeaturescolored(img, scales, paderosionsize, outputfilename)
% createfeaturescolored(img, scales, paderosionsize,
% outputfilename)
%
% Recieves a colored non-mydriatic image, generates and writes each
% pixel's features on file named "outputfilename". "scales" is a
% vector indicating what scales of the Morlet wavelet are used for
% features. "paderosionsize" indicates the size of the erosion
% performed before extending the image with our padding. Features are
% saved in form of a three-dimensional matrix indexad by (x, y, c),
% where (x, y) is the pixel's position in the image and (c) is a
% feature.
